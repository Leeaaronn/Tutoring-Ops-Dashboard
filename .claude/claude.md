## Project Guardrails (must follow)
- Keep code simple and boring. Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- SQLite-first, but schema should be Postgres-friendly.
- Fake/anonymized data only. No real student names.
- Always implement in small steps with verification:
  - run: uv sync --all-extras
  - run: make lint
  - run: make format-check
  - run: make test
- If any command fails, STOP and fix before proceeding.
- Add tests for every “business truth” metric.
- Do not build Streamlit UI until data model + metrics + tests are complete.
